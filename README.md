A line following robot is a wheeled robot which follows a track , usually a black line . The robot has an IR sensor which senses the dark patches of the track and convert it into binary format. This is then converted into a PWM signal with the help of a microcontroller. Then this signal is sent to the motors which drive the robot. In the above instance, we've built a 2 wheel line following robot using 2 dc motors, a motor driver, IR sensor with 6 input, a 9V lipo battery and the arduino nano development board as the micro controller.
